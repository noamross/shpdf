# shpdf

A tiny Chrome extension to go right to the full-screen PDF of any Sci-Hub
paper.  Useful if you have other extentions/workflows that can work on a PDF
but not an iframe (e.g., Paperpile).  

Currently set to run on sci-hub.tw, sci-hub.love, and sci-hub.nu. Others
can be added in the [`manifest.json`](manifest.json).
